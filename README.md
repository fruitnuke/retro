## Hunt the Wumpus

An implementation in Python 2.7 of the original "Hunt the Wumpus" game by
Gregory Yob circa the mid 1970s, as described in
[The Best of Creative Computing Volume 1](http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=247). This
implementation remains true to the original game play, including bugs
(features?) that are present in the original implementation.  I've made only
typographical adjustments and the addition of a 'q' key to quit.

	$ python wumpus.py

## Hammurabi

[Hammurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamurabi) is a game of
resource-management, the text-based ancestor of games like Civilization. You
play the role of ruler of Sumeria over a decade, during which your decision as
to how much to feed your people, how much land to buy and sell and harvest,
decide the fate of your city. Written in Python 3 and based on the 1978
implementation in
[BASIC Computer Games](http://atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=78).

    $ python3 hammurabi.py
