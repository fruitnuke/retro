<a name="hunt-the-wumpus" class="anchor" href="#hunt-the-wumpus"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hunt the Wumpus</h2>

<p>An implementation in Python 2.7 of the original "Hunt the Wumpus" game by
Gregory Yob circa the mid 1970s, as described in
<a href="http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=247">The Best of Creative Computing Volume 1</a>. This
implementation remains true to the original game play, including bugs
(features?) that are present in the original implementation.  I've made only
typographical adjustments and the addition of a 'q' key to quit.</p>

<pre><code>$ python wumpus/wumpus.py
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="hammurabi" class="anchor" href="#hammurabi"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hammurabi</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamurabi">Hammurabi</a> is a game of city
management, the text-based ancestor of games like Civilization. You play the
role of ruler of Sumeria over a decade, during which your decision as to how
much to feed your people, how much land to buy and sell and harvest, decide the
fate of your city. Written in Python 3 and based on the 1978 implementation in
<a href="http://atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=78">BASIC Computer Games</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 hammurabi/hammurabi.py
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="dukedom" class="anchor" href="#dukedom"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dukedom</h2>

<p>A more complex simulation of city management than Hammurabi,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukedom_%28game%29">Dukedom</a>
places you as the Duke of a duchy, competing with other duchies to build your
population and land, defeat them in battle, and ultimately challenge the King
for the crown. Dukedom adds war, taxes, population moral, disease and a random
generation system based on normal curves that means every game will be
different.</p>

<p>Based on the implementation in
<a href="http://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/showpage.php?page=11">Big Computer Games 1984</a>
(see the same for playing instructions). Created by Vince Talbot in 1976,
revised by Jamie Hanrahan and converted to Microsoft Basic by Richard Kaapke.</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 dukedom/dukedom.py
