{"name":"Retro Games","tagline":"Wherein I implement retro games.","body":"## Hunt the Wumpus\r\n\r\nAn implementation in Python 2.7 of the original \"Hunt the Wumpus\" game by\r\nGregory Yob circa the mid 1970s, as described in\r\n[The Best of Creative Computing Volume 1](http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=247). This\r\nimplementation remains true to the original game play, including bugs\r\n(features?) that are present in the original implementation.  I've made only\r\ntypographical adjustments and the addition of a 'q' key to quit.\r\n\r\n\t$ python wumpus/wumpus.py\r\n\r\n## Hammurabi\r\n\r\n[Hammurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamurabi) is a game of city\r\nmanagement, the text-based ancestor of games like Civilization. You play the\r\nrole of ruler of Sumeria over a decade, during which your decision as to how\r\nmuch to feed your people, how much land to buy and sell and harvest, decide the\r\nfate of your city. Written in Python 3 and based on the 1978 implementation in\r\n[BASIC Computer Games](http://atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=78).\r\n\r\n    $ python3 hammurabi/hammurabi.py\r\n\r\n## Dukedom\r\n\r\nA more complex simulation of city management than Hammurabi,\r\n[Dukedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukedom_%28game%29)\r\nplaces you as the Duke of a duchy, competing with other duchies to build your\r\npopulation and land, defeat them in battle, and ultimately challenge the King\r\nfor the crown. Dukedom adds war, taxes, population moral, disease and a random\r\ngeneration system based on normal curves that means every game will be\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nBased on the implementation in\r\n[Big Computer Games 1984](http://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/showpage.php?page=11)\r\n(see the same for playing instructions). Created by Vince Talbot in 1976,\r\nrevised by Jamie Hanrahan and converted to Microsoft Basic by Richard Kaapke.\r\n\r\n\t$ python3 dukedom/dukedom.py\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
